        Things I do that may annoy you or be misunderstood:
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Iâ€™m always late. I underestimate how much time I need to get ready.
          Please don't be disappointed at me. I'm making conscious effort to be
          less late. At the same time, I suggest telling me our meeting time 30
          minutes earlier than planned to ensure our dinner reservation is not
          cancelled.
        </li>
        <li>
          English is not my first language, so you can never tell if I've
          offended you subconsciously or intentionally.
        </li>
        <li>
          My brain is hype when I'm excited about our conversation. I will
          interupt you at least a few times. Otherwise, I forget what I want to
          tell you. I apologize ahead, but hey that means I love talking to you.
        </li>
        <li>
          I overestimate how much I can do in a day. I have an ambitious
          calendar.
        </li>
      </ul>
