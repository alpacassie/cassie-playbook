      <h2>Things I do that may annoy you or be misunderstood:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          i’m always late, always underestimate how much time i need to get
          ready or i use as long as possible + 10min to get ready
        </li>
        <li>
          english is not my first language, so you can never tell if I offend
          you subconsciously or intentionally
        </li>
        <li>
          when energy level is low, i’m grumpy and i do not want to social, get
          annoyed but I’ll feel bad later. best energy timestamp: coffee at a
          soothing cafe in the morning (if my sleep was normal) and dinner at a
          hidden gem in the evening. energy dips around noon/2pm, energy is
          better if i have time for a quick nap 20min or close my eyes for
          10min.
        </li>
